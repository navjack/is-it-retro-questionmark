# is-it-retro-questionmark

this is a thing that does stuff.

the stuff i want it to do when i finish it is to:

find a game's year of release and subtract that by the current year and then give you that diff and then subtract diff by the release year of the game and then find a random game from that resulting year and then ask the user if they think that game was old when the game you asked it about came out.

so far it doesn't do that as i'm still sussing things out. sue me.
