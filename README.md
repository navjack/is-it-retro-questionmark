# is-it-retro-questionmark

This is a thing that does stuff.

The stuff I want to do when I finish it is:

find a game's year of release and subtract that by the current year.

then you take that diff and then subtract it by the release year of the game.

Then with that you find a random game from that resulting year.

and then ask the user if they think that game was old when the game you originally started with came out.

The idea for this isn't mine but I like the challenge of trying to do this.

It uses the MobyGames API, but I might only be able to do this with a local database of the same information MobyGames has since querying the API for a random game by year seems impossible. I’m in the process of solving that issue but rate limiting is slowing this down.

the whole concept of the perspective of time when things came out and how arbitrarily we consider things to be “retro” is interesting and this could easily automate that process.
